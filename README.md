# summarizer

Inspired from [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy), summarizer lets you summarize any input text through extraction based algorithms.

As of now, the following algorithms are implemented :

- Luhn
- KL divergence based summarizer (WIP)
- SumBasic

More are being worked on.

## Installation

   ```yaml
   dependencies:

   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "cadmium_summarizer"

SumBasic.new.summarize(long_text)
```
